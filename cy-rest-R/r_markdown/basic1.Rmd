## Introduction

![](http://chianti.ucsd.edu/~kono/images/cyrest_intro1_network.png)

This is an introduction to cyREST using R.  You will learn how to access Cytoscape features from R environment.

### Prerequisites

    * [This is a good introduction to REST](http://www.restapitutorial.com/)
* Basic R knowledge
* Basic knowledge of Cytoscape

### System Requirments
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Cytoscape 3.2.1 or newer](http://cytoscape.org/download.html)
* Latest version of [cyREST app](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest)

## Install R Packages and Basic Setup

### 3rd Party Library
In this tutorial, we will use several popular R packages to make this workflow more realistic. You need to install the following R packages to run this example.

#### igraph
[The igraph package](http://igraph.org/r/) is a de-facto standard graph anaysis library for R.  We will use this for manipulate/analyze graph data sets.

#### HTTP Client
Since you need to access Cytoscape via RESTful API, HTTP client library is the most important tool you need to understand.  In this example, we use [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html).

#### JSON Encoding and Decoding
Data will be exchanged as JSON between Cytoscape and R.  We will use 3rd party package [RJSONIO](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html) in this workflow to encode/decode JSON.

### Basic Setup
At this point, there is only one option for the cy-rest module: port number.

#### URL to Access Cytoscape REST API
We assume that you are running Cytoscape desktop application and R on a same machine.  To access Cytoscape via cyREST, use the following URL:

```
http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER/v1/
```

where __v1__ is the current version number of API.  Once the final release is ready, we guarantee compatibility of your scripts as long as major version number is the same.


#### Changing Port Number
By default, port number used by cy-rest module is __1234__.  To change this, you need set a global Cytoscape property from _Edit-->Preserences-->Properties..._ and add a new property __port.number__.


```{r}
library(RJSONIO)
library(igraph)
library(httr)

# Basic settings
port.number = 1234
base.url = paste("http://localhost:", toString(port.number), "/v1", sep="")

print(base.url)
```

## Test cyREST

### Understanding REST Basics

| HTTP Verb | Description |
|:----------:|:------------|
| GET | Retrieving resources (in most cases, it is Cytoscape data objects, such as networks or tables) |
| POST | Creating resources | 
| PUT | Changing/replacing resources or collections |
| DELETE | Deleting resources |

----

### Check Connection
First, send a simple request and check server status.

```{r}
version.url = paste(base.url, "version", sep="/")
cytoscape.version = GET(version.url)
cy.version = fromJSON(rawToChar(cytoscape.version$content))
print(cy.version)
```

### Generate Network with igraph

```{r}
# 1. Create simple directed graph with Barabasi-Albert model
graph1 <- barabasi.game(200)

# 2. Calculate some statistics and assign then to the graph
graph1$name = "Scale-Free Network (BA Model)"
graph1$density = graph.density(graph1)

V(graph1)$degree <- degree(graph1)
V(graph1)$closeness <- closeness(graph1)
V(graph1)$betweenness <- betweenness(graph1)
V(graph1)$page_rank <- page.rank(graph1)$vector
V(graph1)$community <- label.propagation.community(graph1)$membership

E(graph1)$betweenness <- edge.betweenness(graph1)
```

### Create Custom Visual Style
You can create your own custom Visual Styles as R object.  The best way to learn how to create them is getting preset Styles as JSON.  For example, if you want to see how ___default___ style is composed as JSON, you can get it by the following code.

```{r}
default.style.url = paste(base.url, "styles/default", sep="/")
GET(url=default.style.url)
```

Or, you can simply access the following URL from web browser:

```
http://localhots:1234/v1/styles/default
```

Here is the sample code to generate new Style:

```{r}
style.name = "R Style"

# Defaults
def.node.color <- list(
  visualProperty = "NODE_FILL_COLOR",
  value = "#00aabb"
)

def.node.border.width <- list(
  visualProperty = "NODE_BORDER_WIDTH",
  value = 0
)

def.node.size <- list(
  visualProperty = "NODE_SIZE",
  value = 25
)

def.edge.target.arrow <- list(
  visualProperty="EDGE_TARGET_ARROW_SHAPE",
  value="ARROW"
)

def.edge.width <- list(
  visualProperty="EDGE_WIDTH",
  value=3
)

defaults <- list(
  def.node.color,
  def.node.border.width,
  def.node.size,
  def.edge.target.arrow,
  def.edge.width)

# Visual Mappings
min.betweenness = min(V(graph1)$betweenness)
max.betweenness = max(V(graph1)$betweenness)

mappings = list()

point1 = list(
  value=min.betweenness,
  lesser= "20.0",
  equal="20.0",
  greater="20.0"
)

point2 = list(
  value=max.betweenness,
  lesser="100.0",
  equal="100.0",
  greater="100.0"
)

node.size.continuous.points = list(point1, point2)

node.size = list(
  mappingType="continuous",
  mappingColumn="betweenness",
  mappingColumnType="Double",
  visualProperty="NODE_SIZE",
  points = node.size.continuous.points
)

node.label = list(
  mappingType="passthrough",
  mappingColumn="name",
  mappingColumnType="String",
  visualProperty="NODE_LABEL"
)

mappings = list(node.size, node.label)

style <- list(title=style.name, defaults = defaults, mappings = mappings)
style.JSON <- toJSON(style)

style.url = paste(base.url, "styles", sep="/")
POST(url=style.url, body=style.JSON, encode = "json")
```

### Sending network to Cytoscape
You need to convert your network data into Cytoscape-compatible JSON to send it to Cytoscape.  For your convenience, there is a utility to convert igraph object into JSON:

```{r}
# Load utility functions
source("../utility/cytoscape_util.R")

# Convert to Cytoscape style JSON object
cygraph <- toCytoscape(graph1)

# Send it to Cytoscape!
network.url = paste(base.url, "networks", sep="/")
res <- POST(url=network.url, body=cygraph, encode="json")

# Extract SUID of the new network
network.suid = unname(fromJSON(rawToChar(res$content)))
```

### Apply layout algorithm and Visual Style
Finally, let's apply new Visual Style and layout algorithm:

```{r}
apply.layout.url = paste(
  base.url,
  "apply/layouts/force-directed",
  toString(network.suid),
  sep="/"
)

apply.style.url = paste(
  base.url,
  "apply/styles",
  style.name,
  toString(network.suid),
  sep="/"
)

res <- GET(apply.layout.url)
res <- GET(apply.style.url)
```

### Getting network view as image

```{r}
network.image.url = paste(
  base.url,
  "networks",
  toString(network.suid),
  "views/first.png",
  sep="/"
)
print(network.image.url)
```

You can open the URL above to see the image of new network as PNG.
